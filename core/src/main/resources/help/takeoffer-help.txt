NAME
----
takeoffer - take an offer to buy or sell BTC

SYNOPSIS
--------
takeoffer  (KOINZ v1 Protocol)
		--offer-id=<offer-id>
		--payment-account=<payment-acct-id>
		[--fee-currency=<btc|bsq>]
		[--amount=<offer.min-btc-amount >= amount <= offer.btc-amount>]

takeoffer  (KNZ Swap)
		--offer-id=<offer-id>
		[--amount=<offer.min-btc-amount >= amount <= offer.btc-amount>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Take an existing offer. There are currently two types offers and trade protocols.

    KNZ swap offers

        The takeoffer command only requires an offer-id parameter, and sufficient KNZ and/or BTC
        to cover the trade amount and the taker fee.
        The amount parameter is optional.
        The payment-account parameter is invalid;  KNZ Swap transactions use the default BsqSwapAccount.
        The fee-currency parameter is invalid;  KNZ is always used to pay KNZ swap trade fees.
        The swap will be executed immediately after being successfully taken.

    Version 1 protocol fiat and KNZ offers

        The offer-id and payment-account parameters are required.  The amount parameter is optional.
        The fee-currency parameter can be optionally used to pay the taker fee in KNZ.

OPTIONS
-------
--offer-id
		The ID of the buy or sell offer to take.

--payment-account
		The ID of the fiat payment account used to send or receive funds during the KOINZ v1 protocol trade.
		The payment account's payment method must match that of the offer.
		This parameter is not valid for taking KNZ Swaps, due to swaps' different transaction structure,
		where the default BsqSwapAccount is used.

--fee-currency
		The wallet currency used to pay a KOINZ v1 protocol trade's taker fee (KNZ|BTC).  Default is BTC.
		This parameter is not valid for taking KNZ Swaps, due to swaps' different transaction structure,
		where KNZ is always used to KNZ swap trade fees.

--amount
		The trade's intended btc amount.  The amount must be within the offer's min-amount and (max) amount range.
		If the taken offer's min-amount = amount, this request parameter must be equal the offer's amount (or omitted).
		If this optional request parameter is omitted, the offers (max) amount is set on the new trade.
