NAME
----
verifybsqsenttoaddress - verify KNZ sent to wallet address

SYNOPSIS
--------
verifybsqsenttoaddress
		--address=<bsq-address>
		--amount=<bsq-amount>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Verify an exact amount of KNZ was sent to a specific KOINZ wallet's KNZ address.
Receipt of KNZ to a KNZ (altcoin) payment account address should always be verified
before a KNZ seller sends a confirmpaymentreceived message for a KNZ/BTC trade.

Warning:  The verification result should be considered a false positive if a KNZ wallet
address has received the same amount of KNZ in more than one transaction.  A way to
avoid this problem is to use different KNZ payment accounts for different trades, so
the payment account receiving address will vary from trade to trade.  Another way is to
slightly vary your offer amounts and KNZ prices (if you are the maker), to make sure the
received KNZ amounts vary from trade to trade.  Doing all of the above further reduces
the chance of a false positive.  Another step is to check your KNZ wallet balance when
you verify KNZ has been received to an address.
